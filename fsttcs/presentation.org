* Timing-Based Side Channel Leaks  
** Traditional Cybersecurity
   Traditionally, cybersecurity has dealt with the analysis of *overt* channels.

** What are Side Channels?
   A /side/ channel, on the other hand, involves no such direct access. Instead, vulnerabilities are introduced by *side effects* of a program's execution.
   + Power used during the program's execution
   + Sound generated by the machine running the program
   + *Time it takes for the program to execute*
** An Illustrative Example
   Let us consider a C program that checks some input against a given password by comparing it by character by character.
   #+begin_src C :eval never
   bool matchpwd ( int * input , size_t n ) {
     if ( n != pwd_length ) return false;
     for ( int i = 0; i < n ; i ++) {
       if ( input [ i ] != pwd [ i ]) return false ;
     }
     return true ;
   }
   #+end_src
** An Exploit
   Let's say the password is *101010*, an exploit may look like the following.

** The Reality of Timing Side Channels
   Speculative execution and cache side channels are subtler ways that these vulnerabilities can be introduced.

* Mitigating Timing-Based Side Channel Leaks

* Fall-Through Semantics for Mitigating Timing-Based Side Channel leaks

* (Formal) Fall-Through Semantics for Mitigating Timing-Based Side Channel Leaks


* Methodology

** A simple slide
This slide consists of some text with a number of bullet points:

- the first, very *important*, point!
- the previous point shows the use of *bold* emphasis which is translated to a =\alert{}= directive in \LaTeX.

The above list could be numbered or any other type of list and may include sub-lists.

** A more complex slide
This slide illustrates the use of Beamer blocks.  The following text,
with its own headline, is displayed in a block:
*** Org mode increases productivity				  :B_theorem:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: theorem
    :END:
    - org mode means not having to remember \LaTeX commands.
    - it is based on ASCII text which is inherently portable.
    - Emacs!

    \hfill \(\qed\)

** Two columns

*** A block                                                                                            :BMCOL:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_col: 0.4
    :END:
    - this slide consists of two columns
    - the first (left) column has no heading and consists of text
    - the second (right) column has an image and is enclosed in an *example* block

*** A screenshot                                                                             :B_example:BMCOL:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: example
    :BEAMER_col: 0.5
    :END:

** Babel
   This slide shows some code and resulting output using *Babel*.  Note the specification of =BEAMER_act= property for the second column.
*** Octave code						      :BMCOL:B_block:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_col: 0.45
    :BEAMER_env: block
    :END:
# #+name: octaveexample
# #+begin_src octave :results output :exports both :cache yes
# A = [1 2 ; 3 4]
# b = [1; 1];
# x = A\b
# #+end_src

*** The output                                                   :BMCOL:B_block:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_col: 0.4
    :BEAMER_env: block
    :BEAMER_act: <2->
    :END:

# #+results[a02a5ac71cb90a3f47701ae072b07a361dad15a4]: octaveexample
# #+begin_example
# A =

#    1   2
#    3   4

# x =

#   -1
#    1

# #+end_example

* Conclusions

** Summary
   - org is an incredible tool for time management
   - *but* it is also excellent for writing and for preparing presentations
   - Beamer is a very powerful \LaTeX{} package for presentations
   - the combination is unbeatable!
