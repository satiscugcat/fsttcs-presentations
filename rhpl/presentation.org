* Fall-Through Semantics for Mitigating Timing-based Side Channel Leaks
** An Illustrative Example
   Let us consider a C program that checks some input against a given password by comparing it by character by character.
   #+begin_src C :eval never
   bool matchpwd ( int * input , size_t n ) {
     if ( n != pwd_length ) return false;
     for ( int i = 0; i < n ; i ++) {
       if ( input [ i ] != pwd [ i ]) return false ;
     }
     return true ;
   }
   #+end_src
** An Exploit
   Let's say the password is *101010*, an exploit may look like the following.
*** An Attack Trace                                                  :B_example:

    \alert{10}0000 \dotfill Rejected in 3^{rd} iteration \pause \\
    \alert{1}10000 \dotfill Rejected in 2^{nd} iteration \pause \\
    \alert{1010}00 \dotfill Rejected in 5^{th} iteration \pause \\
    \alert{101}100 \dotfill Rejected in 4^{th} iteration \pause \\
    *101010* \dotfill Password accepted!
 
** Threat Model
   Thus, given an adversary that can execute the program under security label \ell. \pause
*** Data Security       :B_block:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: block
    :END:
    The adversary can view the state of the memory, but values that are high relative to \ell are invisible. \pause
    As an example, let us take \(L \sqsubseteq M \sqsubseteq H\) and let us take \(\ell = M\).

    Let us say our /\mu/ is /x \rightarrow true^{L}, y \rightarrow true^{M}, z \rightarrow true^{H}/, then the adversary's view of the memory is: \pause

    /x \rightarrow true^{L}, y \rightarrow true^{M}, z \rightarrow */
    \pause
*** Timing Security       :B_block:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: block
    :END:
    The adversary has exact knowledge of when and where each memory access takes place during a program's execution.

* Interactive Theorem Proving - What's the Fuss About?
** ITPs
   *Interactive Theorem Provers* have been around for quite a while. However, they have been facing a lot of very /recent/ adoption.
   + LEAN4 (2013)
   + Agda (1999)
   + *Coq/Rocq (1989/2025)*
   + Isabelle (1986)
   + Automath (1967)
** Expressing Mathematical Structures
   [[file:./simple.png]]
** Why Bother?
   The most important thing that we get from these systems is *trust*.
   + *Manual verification* can be error-prone and time-consuming.
   + With a theorem prover, the implementation of the core system is comparitively very *small*.
   + With this base, it is much easier to *trust results* (although there are caveats we will discuss later).

* Interactive Theorem Proving - An Undegraduate Perspective
** Why Did I Bother?
   + I started working on this project during the first semester of my second year. I was taking Discrete Math *at the same time*! \pause
   + During December, I spent some time in IIT Delhi with Prof Vaishnavi Sundararanjan and started properly working with theorem provers. \pause
   + After this, I got extremely anxious about my *proofs and theorems being incorrect*.
** Learning to write Rocq vs Learning to write Proofs
*** Learning Rocq       :B_block:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: block
    :END:
    + *Well documented* and maintained by a team of highly qualified researchers/engineers. \pause
    + Wonderful widely available resources for learning *(Software Foundations)*. \pause
    + At the end of the day, it is a programming language! Possibility of *transfer*. \pause
*** Learning Proofs       :B_block:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: block
    :END:
    + Universally accepted resources do not exist (as far as I know). \pause
    + Discrete Math courses often focus on *already existing/well-studied structures*. \pause But (from what I know), not as much work in *defining and using your own*. \pause
    + Learning by example is difficult: "The proof is trivial", or "The proof follows simply from induction on /x/". 
** Intuition
   Intuition plays a big role in proofs. \pause Take for example the pumping lemma for context free grammars. \pause

** Intuition in ITPs
   + There is *almost no room* for intuition in ITPs. \pause
   + This is bad. Spending time on things obvious by intuition, may hamper the *non-obvious* things. \pause
   + This is good. It allows for stronger guarantees. \pause *As a student, by default, your intuition is non-existent or bad.*
** Costs and Caveats
   \pause
   + Error in *specification*. \pause
   + *Bugs* in prover-software. Possibility of *breaking updates*. \pause
   + Benefits from *abstractions*. \pause
   + Strictness can cause difficulty in *iteration*.
** Concluding
   That's all! Thank you for attending my talk. I am part of a student club called *,\\ AMBDA.* at IIT Gandhinagar where we like to work on interesting things in PLT along with organising talks to cultivate interest in PLT.
